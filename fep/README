I've not maintained this program for long time and I myself don't use
it often.  But it seems there are some people who are still using my
clumsy tool and amazingly new users are still coming.

They kindly send bug reports, fixes and enhancements for me.  I'm only
applying them and distributing in a package.  The latest archive is
placed here for historical reason:

	ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/cmd/

It's probably named fep.tar.gz or something like that.  Any
improvement is still welcome especially POSIX support.

FEP is a general purpose front end for any line-oriented command on
UNIX. This command was developed on Berkeley UNIX, but will probably
run on most UNIX system which have pseudo tty and the select system
call.

Making FEP

	Just type 'make'.
	If your system is running ASCII UNIX or some compatible system,
	the -DKANJI flag makes fep handle kanji character input.

Using FEP

	See man page fep.1 for detail.
	The help command (ESC-?) and show-bindings command (^X-^B) are
	very convenient when running fep.

Distribution

	Distribution without fee is permitted as long as all
	copyright notices are included.

Any comments will be greatly appreciated. Have fun.
